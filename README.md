This repo contains two basic security exploits and some additional resources, designed for participants of the Intro to Security Engineering workshop at Hack The North 2020++. 

## 0-weak-credentials
Contains a password-protected PDF file. A successful attack unlocks the PDF file to reveal the secret word inside. (If you prefer, there is also a txt file encrypted using Vim.)
