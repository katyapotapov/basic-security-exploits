# Intro to Security Engineering Workshop - HTN 2020++
This repo contains two basic security exploits and some additional resources, designed for participants of the Intro to Security Engineering workshop at Hack The North 2020++. 

## 0-weak-credentials
Contains a password-protected PDF file. A successful attack unlocks the PDF file to reveal the secret word inside. (If you prefer, there is also a txt file encrypted using Vim.)

## 1-sql-injection
A simple SQL injection problem presented in a SQL Fiddle. A successful attack returns the entire table that the query runs on.

## Workshop-related resources
Here are some resources related to topics we discussed during the workshop:

[OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) - the top 10 security risks facing web applications today.

[MITRE ATT&CKÂ®](https://attack.mitre.org/) - a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

[Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) - a search engine for Internet-connected devices. **Use for ethical purposes only!**

[How Password Managers Work (Computerphile)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w68BBPDAWr8) - 12-minute explanation of password managers by Dr. Mike Pound. Would strongly recommend subscribing to his channel if you haven't already!
